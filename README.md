# No More Vehicles

Reverts the patch made by the [More Vehicles](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1764208250) mod to the ``VehicleManager`` so savegames and maps can be loaded without the mod. See the [Steam Workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2861626381) for instructions.
